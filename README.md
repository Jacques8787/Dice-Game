# Dice Game ðŸŽ²

This is a fun, interactive dice game built using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The game allows two players to take turns rolling dice and accumulating points. The first player to reach the target score wins the game!

## Features

- Two-player mode
- Dice roll functionality
- Hold current score or risk rolling again
- Game resets after a winner is declared
- Simple and intuitive UI

## Key Concepts

This project demonstrates the use of:
- **DOM manipulation**: Interacting with the HTML elements dynamically based on the game state.
- **Event listeners**: Handling player actions such as rolling the dice and holding the score.
- **Game logic**: Implementing the rules of the game, detecting the winner, and handling game resets.

## How to Play

1. Each player takes turns rolling the dice.
2. If a player rolls a `1`, their turn ends, and they lose the points they haven't saved.
3. Players can choose to "Hold" and save their current points, passing the turn to the other player.
4. The first player to reach the target score wins the game!

1. Clone this repository:
